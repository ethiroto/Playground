                    Hirocult is a site ran by me (hiroto kei) which serves as the creative nexus for everything I do.
                    Long term, I plan on hosting unreleased music, art/photo projects, links to my work, and games all
                    collected here.
                    The version you are seeing now is it in its infancy. I just started, and I have much bigger plans.
                    Have fun taking a look around!
